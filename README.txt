libevent-python
---------------

libevent-python is a CPython extension module that wraps the lightweight C 
library 'libevent', available at http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/.

libevent provides a unified interface to a variety of IO multiplexing 
mechanisms (select, poll, kqueue, epoll) and an event loop that supports
timed events and signal handlers.

For usage examples, see the examples/ directory, which should grow as 
libevent-python matures.
